Enhancement: Parallelize reading of snapshots

Restic used to read snapshots sequentially. For repositories containing
many snapshots this slowed down commands which have to read all snapshots.
Now the reading of snapshots is parallelized. This speeds up for example
`prune`, `backup` and other commands that search for snapshots with certain
properties or which have to find the `latest` snapshot.
